#Mean is represent my μ (sum/N)

# Standard Deviation
# |xi-μ| is how far i deviates from the mean
# Average deviation is sum/N
# This is not common in signals

# Standard Deviation: σ (sigma)
# square root of 1/(N-1) * sum( (xi-μ)^2 ) from i=0 to N-1
# Variance is σ^2
# Root Mean Square  = σ 

# Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) = μ/σ
# Coefficient of Variation: cv = μ/σ * 100

ADC: Analog to Digital Converter
    Needed for the computer to process
    2 Main Modules:
        -Sampler/Hold Module
            -keeps the voltage constant while the convergion is taking place
            -allowed to change only at periodic intervals
            -converts Independent variable
        -Quantizer
            -converts dependent Variable

Proper Sampling: Aility to reconstruct exact analog signal from samples

Sampling Theory/Nyquist Theorem: SamplingFrequency >= 2*MaxFrequency
